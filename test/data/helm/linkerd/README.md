# Linkerd test certificates

Since the linkerd helm cannot be rolled out withou an existing set of CA and issuer certificates and keys, there are 
dummy certificates here, so that no separate tool to generate them is required within various docker images used in
processing the code of this project

THESE ARE FOR LOCAL TESTING PURPOSES ONLY! DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION OR EVEN INTEGRATION TESTS!
